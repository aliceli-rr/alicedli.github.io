## Hand-written Digit Recognition 
* Developed two predictive models in Matlab to recognize handwritten digits
* Implemented one-vs-all classification by training regularized logistic regression classifiers and backpropogation algorithms, which reported 94.9% and 95.3% accuracy rates respectively

## LendingClub Project
* Built two predictive models in Python to determine whether borrowers will pay loans back in full using raw data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)
* Implemented decision tree and random forest tree classifiers, reporting average f1-scores of 74% and 80% respectively   

## Canadian GDP Time Series Analysis
* Applied statistical time series analysis in R with Canadian GDP and S&P data
* Selected ARMA(p,q) model, forecasted growth rates, applied diagnostic tests
* Determined if S&P Index follows a random walk stochastic process

## Extreme Value Theory Risk Management Application
* Analyzed extreme outcomes and dependencies of stock returns in R
* Fitted data with GEV and GPDs distributions; tested concordance, tail dependence and selected copula that models the aggregate losses
