<center> Hi, I'm Alice. Welcome to my site!</center>

I am a 4th year Statistics and Risk Management student at University of Waterloo with a passion in data science and statistical modelling.

Currently I am working as a Data Scientist co-op in RBC's Cyber Analytics team, where I work with cybersecurity experts to develop and implement machine learning algorithms to identify complex threat scenarios. 

Feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to chat with me.
